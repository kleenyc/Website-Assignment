					The first real snow storm in this inconsistenly cold and not-too-cold winter. Usually by this time of the year I am just about done with the freezing temps but this year is bearable. I like!

					Today marks the start of a 2-week long celebration of Lunar New Year. This year is the Year of the Rooster. The Years of the Rooster include 1921, 1933, 1945, 1957, 1969, 1981, 1993, 2005, 2017, 2029... The Rooster is known to be associated with optimism, confidence, and practicality, but also tend to be pretty opinionated and demanding. Hmmm... any Roosters out there? I better watch out! :-O
